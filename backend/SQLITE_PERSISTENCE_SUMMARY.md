# 🎯 SQLite Persistence on Railway - Complete Setup

## ✅ What's Been Configured

Your CS2 Player Stats API now has **persistent SQLite storage** on Railway! Here's what was set up:

### 🔧 Technical Changes Made

1. **Volume Configuration** (`railway.toml`):
   ```toml
   [[deploy.volumes]]
   mountPath = "/app/data"
   name = "cs2_database_volume"
   ```

2. **Database Path Logic** (`api_server.py`):
   - Production: Uses `/app/data/player_stats.db` (persistent volume)
   - Development: Falls back to `./player_stats.db` (local)
   - Auto-initialization: Copies initial DB to volume on first run

3. **Database Initialization**:
   - Automatically creates volume directory
   - Copies your existing database to persistent storage
   - Ensures seamless transition from ephemeral to persistent

### 📊 Test Results
```
✅ Database path logic works
✅ Database connection successful  
✅ Volume initialization works
✅ Ready for Railway deployment
✅ 217 player stats records verified
✅ 5 database tables confirmed
```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Quick Deploy (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/johanpbj/projects/claude_area/cs2/backend
./deploy.sh
```

### Manual Deploy
```bash
railway login
railway init  
railway up
```

## 💾 How Persistence Works

| Scenario | Database Location | Persistence |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **First Deploy** | Copies to `/app/data/player_stats.db` | ✅ Persistent |
| **App Restart** | Reads from `/app/data/player_stats.db` | ✅ Data Preserved |
| **New Deploy** | Uses existing `/app/data/player_stats.db` | ✅ Data Preserved |
| **Local Dev** | Uses `./player_stats.db` | 🔄 Local Only |

## 🔍 Verification After Deploy

```bash
# Check your deployment
railway logs

# Verify volume is mounted
railway shell
ls -la /app/data/

# Check database file
file /app/data/player_stats.db
```

## 📋 Key Benefits

✅ **True Persistence**: Data survives all restarts and deployments  
✅ **Automatic Setup**: No manual database migration needed  
✅ **Development Friendly**: Works locally and in production  
✅ **Backup Ready**: Easy to download/backup the database file  
✅ **Cost Effective**: No additional database service fees  

## 🆚 Comparison with Alternatives

| Solution | Persistence | Setup | Cost | Scalability |
|----------|-------------|-------|------|-------------|
| **SQLite + Volume** | ✅ Yes | 🟢 Easy | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium |
| Railway PostgreSQL | ✅ Yes | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 High |
| External PostgreSQL | ✅ Yes | 🔴 Complex | 🔴 High | 🟢 High |

## 📚 Documentation Created
